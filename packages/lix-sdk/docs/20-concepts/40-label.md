## Description 

TODO

## Pre-defined Labels

- `confirmed` - Confirming changes acts as filter for the graph. Seeing all changes is oftentimes overwhelming. Use confirmed as filter for the history. 
- `grouped` - Changes in a group are treated as a single unit. They are merged, applied, and tested for conflicts together.

## Examples

- Tag a change set as confirmed e.g. the changes in the set should not be changed anymore.
