# InlangAddVariable

The component is currently only used inside of the bundle. That means that it can't be slotted.

<Canvas of={InlangAddInput.Example} />

#### Props:
- `bundle`: The bundle

#### Event:
- `change`: The component dispatches a change event that contains all necessary information.

> The event bubbles up, so you can have a change event listener on a higher level.
