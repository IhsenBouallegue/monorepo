# InlangBundle
 
The InlangBundle component shows a single message of a bundle. (Example: "en" is a message of a certain bundle referenced in code).

## Plain usage

The compoent allows the following:
- Show the variants in a listener
- Show the locale of the message
- Show the configured selectors 

#### Simple
<Canvas of={InlangBundle.Example} />

#### Complex
<Canvas of={InlangBundle.Complex} />

#### Props:
- `bundle`: The bundle as Bundle (not BundleNested)

#### Event:
- `change`: The component dispatches a change event that contains the message information.

> The event bubbles up, so you can have a change event listener on a higher level.

#### Slots: (Might change in the future)
- `message`: Slot the InlangMessage components
- `bundle-action`: To slot the InlangBundleAction components (to fill the three dot menu on the top right)
